Keep in mind that this BNF doesn't include the semantic actions (the code that manipulates the parse tree), but it does capture the syntax of the language being parsed.

compactdata = top-level-map / value

top-level-map = pair-list

pair-list = pair [SEMICOLON pair-list]

pair = key EQUALS value / key map / key array

map = LPAREN [pair-list] RPAREN

array = LBRACKET [value-list] RBRACKET

value-list = array-value [SEMICOLON value-list]

array-value = orphan-pair / value

orphan-pair = pair

value = QUOTED_STRING / GRAVE_STRING / reserved / unquoted-value / map / array

reserved = "NULL" / "TRUE" / "FALSE"

unquoted-value = UNQUOTED_VALUE

key = UNQUOTED_VALUE / QUOTED_STRING / GRAVE_STRING
